# Project: Russian Travel

Hello there!
My name is Olya. I was born and raised in Siberia, but I live in California now.

I've just started my study as a web developer and this is my second project I created from scratch by myself.
This project is about travelling across Russia. You can learn about some places you can visit and take a look at these beautiful pictures.

I made this website responsible using HTML and CSS. I am planning to add some JS to the website once I am familiar with it :)

Hope you like it.
Enjoy :)
